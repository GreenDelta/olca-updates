openLCA â€“ modules
=================
This project provides the update functionality for [openLCA](http://openlca.org). 
Since version version 1.6 the [openLCA application](https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-app) 
is using this component to update existing databases. 
Updates themselves are written in python and define their meta data in a manifest file.
